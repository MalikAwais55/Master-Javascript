📌 What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.
JavaScript is a asynchronous single threaded language 
It is used to make websites interactive and dynamic. It runs in the browser and allows you to create things like:

🔹 Animations & Effects (e.g., sliders, pop-ups)
🔹 User Interactions (e.g., buttons, forms, dropdowns)
🔹 Real-Time Updates (e.g., live chat, notifications)
🔹 Game Development 🎮
🔹 Backend Development (with Node.js)

🤔 Why Do We Use JavaScript?

🔹 Makes Websites Interactive – HTML & CSS create the structure and design, but JavaScript adds life to web pages.
🔹 Runs in the Browser – No need for extra software; it works directly in Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers.
🔹 Fast & Lightweight – Executes quickly without slowing down the website.
🔹 Works on All Devices – Responsive and mobile-friendly.
🔹 Huge Community & Support – Millions of developers use JavaScript, so you’ll always find help online.
🔹 Can Be Used for Full-Stack Development – With Node.js, you can use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.

🎯 Where is JavaScript Used?

📌 Websites & Web Apps
📌 Mobile Apps (React Native)
📌 Server-side (Node.js)
📌 Game Development
📌 AI & Machine Learning

JavaScript is everywhere! 🌍 If you want to become a web developer, learning JavaScript is a must! 🚀

🌟 What is the JavaScript V8 Engine?

The V8 Engine is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It runs JavaScript code inside web browsers and even on servers with Node.js. V8 is written in C++ and is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute to its improvement.

🌟 Why is V8 Important?

🔹 Runs JavaScript Super Fast – It compiles JavaScript into machine code instead of interpreting it, making execution much faster.
🔹 Used in Google Chrome & Node.js – Powering modern web applications and backend services.
🔹 Memory Optimization – Efficiently manages memory for better performance.
🔹 Supports ES6+ Features – Keeps up with the latest JavaScript improvements.
🔹 Garbage Collection – Automatically frees up unused memory to keep applications running smoothly.

🌟 How Does V8 Work?

1️⃣ Parses JavaScript Code – Reads and converts JavaScript into a format the computer understands.
2️⃣ Compiles to Machine Code – Uses the JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler to convert JavaScript into fast machine code.
3️⃣ Optimizes Execution – Removes unnecessary operations and improves performance.
4️⃣ Handles Garbage Collection – Automatically manages memory to avoid slowdowns.

🌟 Where is V8 Used?

📌 Google Chrome – Runs JavaScript for web pages.
📌 Node.js – Enables JavaScript to run on the server.
📌 Deno – A modern JavaScript runtime built on V8.
📌 Electron – Used in desktop apps like VS Code.

V8 is the backbone of modern JavaScript performance and plays a huge role in making JavaScript one of the fastest and most widely used languages today! 🚀

🌟 JavaScript: A Multi-Paradigm Language

JavaScript supports multiple programming styles, making it flexible and powerful. The two main paradigms it follows are:

🔹 Imperative Programming – Focuses on how to do something, using step-by-step instructions (like loops and conditions).

🔹 Declarative Programming – Focuses on what should be done, letting built-in functions handle execution.

Since JavaScript supports both styles, developers can choose the best approach depending on the problem they are solving.

🌟 Difference Between Value & Variable

🔹 Value: A piece of data like a number, text, or boolean. Example: 10, "Hello", true.

🔹 Variable: A container that stores a value, allowing us to reuse and modify it. Example: let age = 25; (Here, age is a variable storing the value 25).

Simple Example:
🔹 Value: "Apple" (Just a piece of data)
🔹 Variable: let fruit = "Apple"; (Stores the value "Apple")

A variable holds a value, and the value can change, but the value itself is just data.

🌟 Is JavaScript Case-Sensitive? Yes!

JavaScript treats uppercase and lowercase letters differently, so you must be careful with naming.

📌 Key Points:
🔹 Variables Matter – myVariable and myvariable are not the same.
🔹 Functions & Keywords – Built-in functions like console.log must be in lowercase, or they will cause errors.
🔹 File Names (In Some Cases) – On case-sensitive file systems, script.js and Script.js are different files.

Always be consistent with capitalization to avoid unexpected bugs! ⚡

📌 JavaScript Variable Declaration Rules
1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).
✅ let userName;
❌ let user-name; (Hyphens are not allowed)

2. Variable names must begin with a letter.
✅ let name;
❌ let 1stName; (Cannot start with a number)

3. Variable names can also begin with $ or _ (but it’s not commonly used).
✅ let _privateVar;
✅ let $dollarVar;

4. Variable names are case-sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
✅ let userName;
✅ let UserName; (This is a different variable)

5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as variable names.
❌ let let;
❌ let function;

6. Variable names should be descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention (camelCase or snake_case).
✅ let firstName; (camelCase)
✅ let user_age; (snake_case)
❌ let x; (Not descriptive)

7. Variable names should not be too long (but this is a best practice, not a strict rule).
✅ let userName;
❌ let theUserNameOfTheCurrentLoggedInPerson; (Too long)

8. Variable names should not start with capital letters (by convention).
✅ let userAge;
❌ let UserAge; (Avoid starting with uppercase)

9. Variable names should not contain spaces.
✅ let userName;
❌ let user name; (Spaces are not allowed)

By following these rules, you’ll write clean and error-free JavaScript code! 


📌 What is a Data Type in JavaScript?
A data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold. JavaScript has two types of data: Primitive and Non-Primitive.

🌟 Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are immutable (cannot be changed) and stored by value.

Examples of Primitive Data Types:
🔹 String → "Hello, JavaScript!"
🔹 Number → 42, 3.14
🔹 Boolean → true, false
🔹 Undefined → let x; (A variable declared but not assigned a value)
🔹 Null → let y = null; (Intentional empty value)
🔹 BigInt → 123456789012345678901234567890n (For very large numbers)
🔹 Symbol → Symbol('unique') (Used for unique identifiers)

🌟 Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types
Non-primitive data types are mutable (can be changed) and stored by reference.

Examples of Non-Primitive Data Types:
🔹 Object → { name: "John", age: 30 }
🔹 Array → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
🔹 Function → function greet() { console.log("Hello!"); }
🔹 Date → new Date();
🔹 RegExp → /\d+/ (Regular expressions)


🔥 Difference Between Primitive & Non-Primitive Data Types

🔸 Storage Type:
Primitive types are stored by value.
Non-primitive types are stored by reference.

🔸 Mutability:
Primitive types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed.
Non-primitive types are mutable, meaning their values can be modified.

🔸 Memory Storage:
Primitive types are stored in the stack memory.
Non-primitive types are stored in the heap memory.

🔸 Example:
let x = 10; (Value is stored directly in memory)
let obj = { name: "John" }; (A reference to the object is stored in memory)
